-- this project uses heuristic method to judge the value of states
-- our heuristic is as follows, where a smaller number is better:
--
-- (100 * (total positions to the right of "XX") - 50 * (empty spaces to the right of "XX"))
--
-- The idea is that the closer "XX" is to the right, the closer the puzzle is to being solved.
-- "XX" is closer to the right when it has fewer empty or blocked positions to its right.
-- Also, positions filled by other vehicles require more moves to free up, 
-- so filled spaces are twice as costly as empty spaces for our heuristic calculation.  
--
-- We implement our heruistic by sorting the states by this value in our state generation function.
